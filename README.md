# Useless Machine üéÉ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ö´

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Davy John's Locker

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Anubind C Biju - Muthoot Institute Of Technology And Science

### Project Description
This interactive web project features a spooky theme, where a skeleton arm taps a button to turn a light on and off while eerie music and bats animate around the screen.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Not enough spooky ambiance in web projects for Halloween season.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Create a web-based Halloween display that turns a switch on and off using a skeleton arm, adds spooky sounds, and random bat animations for a hauntingly interactive experience.
